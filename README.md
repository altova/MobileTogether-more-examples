# MobileTogether-more-examples
More MobileTogether examples, including sound effects, localization, holiday schedule, push notifications, etc. 

We invite you to download these apps, open them in the MobileTogether Designer, execute them in the Simulator window, and examine them to familiarize yourself with mobile app development using MobileTogether.

The Holiday Schedule app is described in the Altova blog here: https://blog.altova.com/mobile-app-calendar-integration/

The UI Guide app is the example used in the guide titled Creating Elegant User Interfaces for Cross-Platform Mobile Apps available from Altova at https://www.altova.com/whitepapers/Elegant_User_Interfaces.pdf

The included sample data is a sqlite database that must be installed at C:\MTworking\SampleData\CompanySalesDB\companySales.sqlite for access by the MobileTogether Designer
